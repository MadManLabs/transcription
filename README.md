# Live Transcript 

A small application to use computer speach to text to show translation online and live. This makes sense for scenarios such as hearing impaired or recording something to be more machine readable.

NOTE: This requires the Chrome browser for the speaker. It uses a built in feature in Chrome for text to speach 

# Prerequisites

1. node.js
2. git
3. Chrome browser

# Getting started

```javascript

git clone https://github.com/marktnoonan/transcription.git

npm install

npm start

point your Chrome browser to localhost:3000

```
